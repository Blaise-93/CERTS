# CERTIFICATES :

Hi there, Welcome to my github page. My name is _Blaise Ejikeme_ [ __Blaisemart__ ]. 

 I am a self taught __software engineer__ with huge passion and experience in developing scalable, high performance database driven applications and test the application to boost it's productivity fo users/clients. I have a strong background in backend development with python prior to diving deep in JavaScript and ReactJS, thanks to __Scrimba__, __HNG__, __freecodeCamp__ and __MDN__. I can work independently at ease as well as collaborate with my team for project workflow depending on clients arrangement or the nature of the project.

 In my works, I infuse best of both world of frontend and backend development to create my work from scratch  having UI/UX in mind as well as their security while using the application.
 I can also work on already existing codebase at ease with your team if I am hired.

## Tech Stack:
My tech stack which I use for my backends work is Python (Django or FASTAPI) while at the frontend I either use ReactJS or vanilla JavaScript for the website behavior. While for UI design, Documentations and Accessibility I use SASS, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, GIt, Github, Markdown, and FIGMA. I have extensive knowledge of SQL, and my favorite is my Postgresql, and I can write and query complex schemas. Other SQL I am comfortable working with are MySQL, SQLite. For NOSQL I use firebase sometimes to deploy my project, however, I have started learning Mongodb and NODEJS too. I use Jasmine and Jest to test my JavaScript/React codes while for Python/Django I use in built Unittest to write my testcases. Curiosity and ability to be better and stay up to date as fullstack developer and continue to contribute to the unending software 
engineering have made me to keep on learning and work with teams and community. 

## My Tech Skills:
1. Adept at fundamental front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

2. Adept at developing and deploying seemliness backend website applications and Application Programming interfaces (APIs)

3. Proficiency with server-side language such as Django (Rest_Framework), Python and FASTAPI.

4. Adept at Javascript framework, ReactJS for building amazing UI/UX frontend application and knowledge of some of it's useful tools like  Redux, React-Router-Dom,
Semantic-UI React and Reactstrap.

5. Experience with backend-as-a-service platform such as Firebase.

6. Working in agile environment and deploying with CI/CD pipeline for clients as well as meeting both technical and business requirements of software systems.

7. Adept at sketching schema designs and iterate on solid engineering architecture of database driving applications.

9. Proficiency with database technology such as MySQL, Postgresql, SQLite.

10. Experience with browser based debugging and performance testing software.
 
11. Adept at testing frameworks or libraries such as Jasmine, Jest for Javascript/ReactJS, and Unittest for Python/Django BDD.

12. Staying abreast of development in web applications and Programming languages.


## Mission and Vision: 
My mission as a software developer coming from health industry (pharmacy) is to be a vocal voice in tech industry and try and bring tech closer to healthcare delivery in my dear country, Nigeria which to me is not yet strong at the moment. Also equally help you, my client find your own voice by building and deploying a secure and high performance website application for your 24/7 customers services.  So, my vision is that someday *__I will leverage on that and help pharmaceutical industry grow and be feasible to their patients without no middleman__*. So yeah, I pray and remain focus I will get it right someday. As someone coming from _health background_, I don't joke with `testing my codes functionality` with some frameworks out there, although it might be boring, but it offers greater good for productivity, thus minimizing unforseen errors.

## The certificate below :

Out of my zeal to learn more, especially React and see how to work with people and community, I chose [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) platform recommended by my mentor, [Engr Joseph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukwuebuka-enyelu-948a31b9) and it is indeed helpful and had shaped my taught process on how to write resusable, refactored codes in Javascript and even in python.
